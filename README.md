For [Ludum Dare][ldjam] #38 A Small World.

A game about a little green man trying to get astronauts off his small world.

Get rid of Buck Rodgers by jumping high when he's on the opposite side
of the world. If jump high enough, he'll be thrown off your world and get
lost in space again.

Play the improved post-compo version [here][post] or have a look at
the original [entry][entry].
